> Which Event Happened First? Deferred Choice on Blockchain Using Oracles

*This repository is part of a research paper and should be viewed in that context.*

# Blockchain Deferred Choice

An implementation and evaluation of the deferred choice workflow pattern on Ethereum, using various oracle architectures and designs to implement events contingent on external data variables.

## Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

- `results`: Results of the simulations as used in the paper
- `scripts`: Helper scripts to start `geth`
- `solidity`: Solidity smart contracts
- `src`: Off-chain components and Node.js framework
  - `/keys`: Private keys of all pre-funded accounts in the genesis block
  - `/providers`: Off-chain oracle provider code
  - `/simulation`: Simulation logic

## Running the Simulations

### Installation
To run the simulations, you will need to have the following packages installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), tested with version `v12.18.3` and npm `6.14.6`
- [Go Ethereum](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/) (`geth`), tested with version `1.9.21-stable`

Everything else is then installed via npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### Starting `geth`
The simulations require certain accounts to be pre-funded.
A custom genesis block and a helpful cleanup/startup script are located in the `scripts` folder:

```bash
cd scripts
./geth.sh
```

### Simulations
There are two simulations:

- `npm run correctness`: Starts the correctness simulation
- `npm run cost`: Starts the cost simulation

Both simulations will output information to the console and a CSV file.

Additionally, the CSV output of the cost simulation can be translated to custom LaTeX code for inclusion in a paper using the `heatmap` script.
